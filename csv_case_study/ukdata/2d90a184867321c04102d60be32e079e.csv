(1) £0.002m of non-voted income has been net against the expenditure for the Registrar of Consultant Lobbyists as arm’s length bodies are shown as a net figure here for presentation purposes. This does not align with SOPS2 where the expenditure is shown as voted and the income as non-voted. See SOPS2 for further detail.,,,,,,,,
(2) Final Outturn reported in the Financial Statements is lower than the provisional outturn reported on HM Treasury’s public expenditure database. Spending in resource DEL has decreased by £5.753 million and spending in capital DEL has decreased by £0.540 million.  The reduction represents a revision to accruals; see Governance Statement ‘post-recess certification’ for further explanation.,,,,,,,,

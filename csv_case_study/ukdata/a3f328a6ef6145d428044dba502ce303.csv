Description,Notes: Interpretation/Limitation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Notes for tables,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Tables are based on data entered by local authorities onto WasteDataFlow for each quarterly return for 2005/6. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,WasteDataFlow is a web-based system for quarterly reporting on municipal waste data by local authorities to central government.  It is also used by the Environment Agency for monitoring biodegradable waste sent to landfill under the Landfill Allowance Trading Scheme.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"In 2005/06 all local authorities in England made four quarterly returns on WasteDataFlow, giving a 100% response rate.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Tables 1 and 3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Regular household collection' means wastes within Schedule 1 of the Controlled Waste Regulations 1992.  Small amounts of commercial and industrial wastes may also be included in the case of collections that include mixed domestic and commercial hereditaments. Wherever possible, these wastes are included in ‘Non-household sources’.  Regular household collection tonnages also include household material which was collected for recycling or composting but rejected as not suitable for recycling, either at collection, during sorting at a Materials Recovery Facility (MRF) or at the gate of the reprocessor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,'Other household sources' refers to Schedule 2 wastes under the Controlled Waste Regulations 1992 ~ those from household sources not collected as part of the ordinary waste collection round service.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"'Civic Amenity Sites' refers to household waste collected at sites provided by local authorities for the disposal of excess household and garden waste free of charge, as required by the Refuse Disposal (Amenity) Act 1978.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"'Household recycling' contains materials sent for recycling, composting or reuse by local authorities as well as those collected from household sources by 'private/ voluntary' organisations. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,'Non household sources (excl. recycling)' includes any wastes collected by a local authority from non-household sources (i.e. not covered by 'Schedules 1 and 2 of the controlled Waste Regulations 1992).   It includes non-household material which was collected for recycling but actually rejected at collection or at the gate of a recycling reprocessor.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,'Non household recycling’ includes municipally collected materials for recycling from commercial sources. It excludes material which was collected for recycling from non-household sources but actually rejected at collection or at the gate of a recycling reprocessor.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Table 2 ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Landfill estimates include recycling, composting or reuse rejects.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Incineration with EfW:  EfW is energy from waste. Also included are amounts rejected for recycling, composting or reuse where incineration with EfW is reported as the final destination of these rejects.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,RDF is refuse derived fuel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"'Recycled/composted' includes household and non-household sources sent for recycling or for centralised composting; home composting estimates are not included in this total.  It also includes small amounts of materials sent for reuse.  Material which was collected for recycling but actually rejected at collection, by the MRF or at the gate of a recycling reprocessor is excluded.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"'Other' includes material which is sent for Mechanical Biological Treatment (MBT), mixed municipal waste sent for Anaerobic Digestion (AD) and that disposed through other treatment processes. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Total municipal waste managed in Table 2 may not match the total municipal waste collected as reported in Table 1 due to stockpiling of waste between reporting periods.  Totals in Table 1 are based on collected municipal waste.  Totals in Table 2 are based on municipal waste that is disposed or sent for recycling/composting.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,N/A - data not available.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Table 3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Figures for Waste Disposal Authorities include all waste collected for recycling or disposal by the WDA and their constituent waste collection authorities.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,A total for England cannot be obtained by summing data from all 394 local authorities - data for Waste Collection Authorities must be excluded to avoid double counting. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,The recycling rate is calculated as X/Y*100 where;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"For WCA and UA, 
X= tonnage of waste collected by the WCA or UA which is sent for recycling/composting/reuse (including private/voluntary collections of waste for recycling),
Y=total tonnage of waste collected by the WCA or UA, recycling and residual waste.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"For WDAs;
X= tonnage of waste collected by the WDA which is sent for recycling/composting/reuse plus tonnages sent for recycling by constituent WCAs (including private/voluntary collections of waste for recycling),
Y=total tonnage of waste collected at Civic Amenity sites by the WDA plus tonnage collected by constituent WCAs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"There will be some differences between these figures and those reported by Authorities under Best Value Performance Indicators, in part due to some definitional differences (e.g. reuse).  
Individual authority performance against targets should be assessed using the BVPI data published by the Audit Commission.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

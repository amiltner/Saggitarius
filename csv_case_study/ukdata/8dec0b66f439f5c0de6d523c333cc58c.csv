"Description / Aims 
","From April 2013, the Government introduced a cap on the total amount of benefit that working-age people can receive so that households on out-of-work benefits will no longer receive more in welfare payments than the average weekly wage for working households.     
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Benefit payments for individual households are capped at £500 per week for couples (with or without children) and single parent households; and at £350 per week for single adult households without children. This is around the average earned income after tax and national insurance deductions for working households.
","The Government’s vision is that separated parents should be encouraged and supported to work together in the interests of their children and to set up their own, family-based child maintenance arrangements. For those who are not able to do this, the Government has introduced the 2012 Child Maintenance Scheme, administered by the Child Maintenance Service. The 2012 scheme delivers two critical changes to the policy and regulations which simplify the approach to child maintenance calculations, and provides a new IT platform on which to administer it. ","The Central Payment System (CPS) provides the Department with a fully integrated payment and accounting solution. It has brought significant improvements in the level of customer service, delivered the flexibility needed to support future methods of payment; and will provide opportunities to identify instances of fraud and official error.  It has also introduced significantly higher levels of resilience to our business, reduced dependency on aged systems, and delivered a flexible platform to meet future business needs.","The objectives of the Fraud, Error and Debt Programme are to:
• Save approximately £2.1 billion in welfare benefit expenditure by the end of 2014/15 financial year.
• Contribute to the Departmental target to reduce the level of overpaid benefit expenditure (the Monetary Value of Fraud and Error) to a maximum of 1.7% by 2015.
• Deliver further fraud and error controls across the benefit and credit systems that are fit for purpose to protect the integrity of the welfare system.
• Deliver a single fraud investigation service as a more efficient way of carrying out benefit fraud investigations currently processed separately by DWP, HMRC and Local Authorities.
• Deliver infrastructure which will support improved future delivery in DWP Fraud, Error and Debt Operations.
• Deliver an effective streamlined debt model for the Department that will enable Government to recover greater levels of debt, and ensure those who move off benefit can still be liable for their debt.

The Programme has adopted a phased delivery approach between 2012 and 2016 and will continue to build on the successful ""Spend to Save"" data matching activity which is well underway to ensure a sustainable reduction in losses in the benefit system. Since 2010, initiatives have generated savings in excess of £1.1bn and will realise further savings through the life of the Programme business case.
","This Project delivers the reassessment, through the Work Capability Assessment, of all relevant Incapacity Benefits customers, all those claiming Income Support on grounds of incapacity, and working age claimants of Severe Disablement Allowance to Employment and Support Allowance. Reassessment commenced in October 2010. The Project objectives are that: 
1) all IB customers gain from a new, simpler, more active benefit; 
2) everyone who could benefit engages with back to work support through the Work Programme; 
3) the right people are on the right benefit, and subject to the appropriate conditionality and help to return to work; and that 
4) all disabled people and people with health conditions are  treated equally over time, and receive fair levels of financial support; with 
5) administration on the same systems for all people on incapacity benefits, cutting down on error and dual provision; and 
6) a transfer to new systems as seamless as possible, with customers’ rate of payment protected as part of transition.
","Personal Independence Payment replaces Disability Living Allowance for people aged 16-64. Support is targeted towards those people who face the greatest challenge to remaining independent and participating in society.  It provides a more objective assessment of needs and is more responsive to changes in those needs.  PIP will be simpler to claim and to administer.
","This Programme implements the recommendations from the independent Sayce Review:
1. to invest more funding and improve the delivery and services available through Access to Work;
2. to move Remploy out of government control, seeking other entities to take over the running of businesses and services, and supporting ex Remploy employees made redundant as part of this process.","The white paper ""The single tier pension; a simple foundation for saving” set out the proposals for state pension reform on 14 January 2013: 

• introducing a single-tier State Pension set above the basic level of means-tested support;
• abolishing the Savings Credit element of Pension Credit for the single tier cohort;
• ending contracting out for Defined Benefit schemes;
• modernising of the delivery of Pension Statements; and 
• transforming Pensions delivery to be ""digital by default"" using Government Digital Services design standards.
","Universal Credit aims to reduce the number of workless households by reducing the financial and administrative barriers to work that exist in the current system of benefits and tax credits. It replaces the complexity of the income-related benefits system (Housing Benefit, Income Support, income-related Employment and Support Allowance, income-related Jobseeker’s Allowance, Working Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit) with a single payment which supports people to find work, find more work, and find better paid work.","The Government’s Coalition Agreement gave a commitment to ""create a single welfare to work programme to help all unemployed people get back into work"". The Work Programme, which has been in place nationally since June 2011, does this by providing an integrated package of back-to-work support for a range of claimants - from Jobseeker’s Allowance (JSA) recipients who have been out of work for some time, to claimants who may have received Employment Support Allowance (ESA) or Incapacity Benefits. 

The innovative features of the Work Programme include: 
1) Payment largely by results, for the first time 
2) A long-term focus – once a claimant is referred to a Work Programme prime provider, they remain with that provider for 2 years 
3) Differential pricing – payments up to £14,000 for getting those with the biggest barriers to employment into sustained work 
4) A process that is not prescribed – providers are given the freedom to innovate and use what works best.
","The Youth Contract builds on the support already available through Jobcentre Plus and the Work Programme and is worth almost £1 billion over its lifetime. At the core of the Youth Contract is: 
o 160,000 wage incentives worth £2,275 each, for employers who recruit an 18-24 year-old from the Work Programme; 
o an extra 250,000 Work Experience or Sector-Based Work Academy places over the three years, ensuring that there is an offer of a Work Experience place for every 18 to 24 year-old who wants one, before they enter the Work Programme; 
o at least 20,000 extra incentive payments worth £1500 each for employers to take on young people as apprentices; and 
o extra support through Jobcentre Plus for all 18-24 year olds, consisting of weekly, rather than fortnightly signing, extra advisor time to provide more back to work support; and a careers interview from the National Careers Service.
The Government is also making extra funding available for the Department for Education to support the most vulnerable NEET 16 and 17 year olds into learning, an apprenticeship, or a job with training. 
","The overarching aim of the Government’s workplace pension reforms is to get more people saving more for their retirement. The Automatic Enrolment Programme ‘went live’ in October 2012, delivering:   
1) Automatic enrolment - a new duty on employers to automatically enrol their eligible workers into a qualifying workplace pension scheme, and an incentive to remain saving in a pension scheme through a mandatory employer contribution.
2) The National Employment Savings Trust – to offer low cost pension provision to individuals on low to moderate earnings and their employers. NEST must accept any employer who wishes to use it to meet their employer duty. 
3) A proportionate compliance regime - run by the Pension Regulator to support these measures. 

The implementation period for the Programme runs to 6 years. Employers subject to the new duty are being 'staged' in by size, starting with the largest, over the period October 2012 to February 2018. Contributions to pension schemes will be phased in over time to provide a period of adjustment for employers and individuals, with full contributions being paid from October 2018. 
Once fully implemented, between 6 to 9 million people are forecast to be newly saving, or saving more, into a workplace pension.

Departmental commentary on actions planned or taken on the MPA RAG rating.,"The project successfully implemented the benefit cap, with phased implementation starting from April 2013. National implementation was completed by the end of September 2013. The actions recommended to the project by the MPA were already part of the existing implementation plan and were necessarily delivered as part of successful implementation. 

The benefit cap has now been rolled out to all Local Authorities across the country

To January 2014 over 38,600 households had been capped, with almost 11,000 no longer capped (28%).  Of those households no longer capped around 40% have gone into work, as indicated by the number of open working tax credit claims.

","The delivery confidence rating published in May 2013 related to the confidence in delivery of Phase 1, which was the progressive take-on and processing of new cases on to the 2012 scheme. All MPA recommendations were accepted and addressed. Subsequently, the Major Projects Authority delivery confidence rating has improved.  ","The system completed a successful rollout in August 2012 and is now well established as a critical component of live operations, routinely processing and accounting for more than 13 million payments each week. Work is underway to address points raised by the MPA about the monitoring of benefits post-Programme closure, and how lessons learned during the Programme, including successes and good practice, were communicated across the Department. A follow up review is planned in the second half of 2014. ","The MPA review in November 2013 recommended ways in which the programme could be structured and driven harder, rather than about the design of the proposed solutions.

The Programme has consequently enhanced its programme management processes and controls to support future successful delivery. The programme has also introduced a new governance structure which was a recommendation in the MPA review. 

The programme has added two debt projects, which will result in an increase in the amount of savings realised for the Government; and the development of the proposed risk assessment capability (Integrated Risk and Intelligence Service) has been transferred from the Programme to the DWP Departmental Security Design and Delivery team.",The Project was handed over into live running in March 2012.  The reassessment of IB cases is continuing as part of established business-as-usual processes.   ,"All Major Project Authority Actions and Recommendations have been completed/closed.
Programme delivery continues to require attention on some key risk areas, especially in relation to Independent Assessor supplier performance. 
Programme structure and governance is being reviewed to ensure it remains effective going forward. 

","The Programme is taking forward all recommendations from the last MPA review. The Programme is on course to achieve delivery within timescales and budget. There are still a number of complex issues that need to be resolved in a short timescale, regarding the closure of Remploy factories, and the programme to help severely disabled people to find and maintain “mainstream” employment.","Clearance of actions from the October MPA review is progressing well:
o A DWP Digital/Agile Governance Framework has been developed to support digital projects.  Monthly meetings are taking place with CO and HMT colleagues to establish a flexible approach to approvals and ensure programme momentum is maintained.
o DWP has appointed a Digital Transformation Director General and Single-Tier Programme requirements have been fed into the requirement for increasing DWP digital skills and capability.  A Digital Academy has been established and a number of the Programme team members are currently undergoing the 8 week development programme.
o We continue to progress early work on the contingency legacy solution as approved by Major Projects Review Group, with clear plans and critical milestones set for making decisions on whether to proceed or pause with the solution.  We are working with legacy suppliers to establish costs for this alternative delivery solution. 
o A set of 9 Key Performance Indicators have been established to track Single-Tier activity and will be populated at appropriate times in the Programme development lifecycle once information becomes available.  
o We continue to work closely with HMRC, our key delivery partner, to ensure plans and governance align.","During 2013, the Programme was reset, culminating in the revised plans announced on 5 December 2013.  These plans included:
o The continued roll-out of Universal Credit to ten pathfinder sites, completed successfully on 7 April 2014 with the extension to Shotton;
o The extension of this live service to include claims from couples in summer 2014, and from families in autumn 2014, with a geographical expansion to other sites in the North West;
o The creation of a rigorous ‘test and learn’ strategy so that both qualitative and quantitative impacts of this live service shape further developments;
o In particular, shaping the work to develop an enhanced digital service, due to start in low volumes in autumn 2014, with progressive development and greater scale through 2015-16;
o With the goal of making Universal Credit available in each part of Great Britain during 2016; and with the majority of existing claims to legacy benefits then moving onto Universal Credit during 2016 and 2017.

Early claimant evaluation results have been positive, showing 90% of people making claims online. Almost two-thirds of claimants think that UC provides a better financial incentive to work.

Progress has also been made against National Audit Office and Public Accounts Committee recommendations, including the strengthening of governance and reporting mechanisms, improving financial management, engaging more strongly with delivery partners, and recasting the business case to reflect the new delivery plan.

","The performance of the programme has significantly improved since the first year.  Official statistics published in December 2013 showed that 208,000 jobseekers have escaped long-term unemployment and found lasting work (normally at least 6 months) through the Work Programme.

Since the launch, the Department has taken, and continues to take, clear and robust action to drive up the performance of the programme and ensure the expected benefits are realised. This has included: placing 12 contracts under Performance Improvement Notices in June 2013; shifting market share to better performing providers in August 2013; and most recently, in March 2014, issuing notice of termination to one contract. 

It is not possible at this time to judge the overall impact of the programme, however a formal impact assessment is planned to be conducted in early 2015. 
","The Project went live in April 2012, and all DWP elements were implemented to agreed timescales. Seven of the 8 MPA recommendations have been acted upon. For example, key indicators of success and management information requirements were agreed and are discussed monthly between officials from DWP, the Implementation Unit, HMT and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. The recommendation to appoint a Joint Senior Responsible Officer for other Government Departments was rejected, but DWP has adopted a joined-up approach with colleagues across government, reflected in these monthly meetings.","The early implementation results are very encouraging. As at March 2014, over three million people had been automatically enrolled in to a workplace pension, with high levels of compliance observed amongst those employers who have staged so far, and opt-out rates amongst employees much lower than expected. As implementation progresses through the staging dates to medium and micro employers, the Programme’s challenges may change. To help manage this there is an extensive programme of research and stakeholder engagement, both to track observed behaviours and to gain first-hand knowledge of how the reforms are playing out on the ground. The Amber rating above provides a realistic balance between the success of the Programme to date, the challenges ahead and the risk management in place.    ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Departmental narrative on schedule, including any deviation from planned schedule (if necessary)","The project closed on 20 February 2014.  While implementation had taken place successfully, a reduced project remained in place beyond the initial planning date to ensure a smooth handover into business as usual occurred.","On 25 November 2013, the 2012 scheme successfully launched the final stage of pathfinder (commencement 3) for all new clients, completing Phase 1 of the Programme. 

Phase 2 will build on the 2012 IT system and will introduce client charging and trigger the start of proactive CSA schemes case closure activity. 

The plans to stage CSA case closure activity now reflect the intent

­ to micro-manage the initial phases of case closure using our tried and tested pathfinder approach;
­ to start initial case closure activities on those legacy scheme clients not receiving maintenance, and to support these clients towards arrangements that best suit their current circumstances; and then
­ to sequence case closure activities to minimise disruption for clients receiving maintenance, particularly where hard fought maintenance is now flowing. 

Phase 2 will commence when the system is ready to support client charging and case closure. 
",Final Programme closure took place in August 2012 following a full and effective handover to DWP Finance teams responsible for managing the system in a “business as usual” environment.,"The new initiatives added to the Programme, and resulting scope change, along with dependencies with other programmes has resulted in a change to the delivery schedule, moving the end date of the Programme to 2016. New initiatives added to the Programme will deliver further fraud, error and debt savings for the taxpayer.","Around 90% of cases have been reassessed or are in the process of being reassessed.  For the majority of these, reassessment has been completed.  Most reassessments will be already completed as planned in 2014.","The Programme delivered as planned, a controlled start for new claims in April 2013, followed by a national roll out for new claims in June 2013. By the early Autumn it was apparent that the average length of an assessment was much longer than planned. The Independent Assessment Providers are consequently increasing their capacity so that overall claim processing times return to a satisfactory level. In the mean time, the start of the reassessment of existing DLA claims has been phased: commencing on 28 October 2013 (Wales, West Midlands, East Midlands and East Anglia) with further roll outs on 13 January 2014 (Southern Scotland) and 3 February 2014 (areas in the North of England). Further phased rollout of Natural Reassessment is dependent on the planned improvement in the performance of the Independent Assessors. ","The Programme is continuing to work closely with commercial and legal colleagues to manage the complexities of the sales and asset disposal processes. Remploy’s commercial process was on course to meet programme timescales and by end September 2013 the commercial process was reaching conclusion, with only the automotive business and its three sites to be completed.  

A number of the Access to Work Sayce recommendations have now been implemented, and work continues with DWP Operations to agree delivery of others. 
","All plans on track.  No deviations from planned schedule.

The Alpha project phase commenced January 2014 and design and development of the IT prototype and business re-engineering is on plan, with customers beginning to user test the system.  Customer feedback will continue to be obtained to support ongoing IT and process development.
","Delivery remains on track against plans announced on 5 December (see above).
At the same time, to support this cultural transformation, the Department has:
• rolled out the Claimant Commitment to all new JSA claims across the country;
• introduced Universal Jobmatch, an online job posting and matching service for jobseekers and companies;
• begun eleven in-work conditionality pilots to test how to best encourage claimants to progress in work
• expanded improved access to digital services across the Jobcentre Plus network. 

",The Work Programme was launched on time on 10th June 2011.  ,"Following an aggressive timetable the Project went live in April 12, as planned, with all DWP elements implemented to agreed timescales.

"Departmental narrative on  budget/forecast variance for 2013/14
(if variance is more than 5%)",The forecast shown above of £14.6m does not take into account payments made by the project to Local Authorities via grants of £12.1m to fund New Burdens. The total spend in 2013/14 is £26.7m. The increase in costs was mainly as a result of additional expenditure on local support to help people into work using the flexible support fund and extending the project team availability by 3 months,"The whole life budget costs reflect the re-baselined business case figures which take account of the three commencement staged pathfinder approach.   

The in year variance of £12m is a result of pressure on suppliers  to reduce their estimates and actual supplier costs proving in some cases to be lower than agreed estimates as well as revised timing of activity e.g. on Disaster Recovery which moved some costs into 2014/15.

",n/a – variance not more than 5%,The reason for the significant under-spend against the in year budget is largely attributable to the change in approach to the Integrated Risk and Intelligence Service Project. Expenditure on the Project was not incurred in line with the original forecast profile.  Following the restructure of the Programme in Summer 2013 a revised approach to the delivery of risk assessment capability is being developed.  ,n/a – variance not more than 5%,"Forecast is 6% less than budget, as the customer journey for PIP claims is taking longer than originally predicted, reducing forecast costs for completed assessments and for appeals.","The favourable variance between budget and forecast is due to the following:
• the budget was based on a planning assumption that Remploy Employment Services (ES) would exit government control during 2013/14.  Subsequent market testing indicated a value for money exit could not be achieved, due to the length of time remaining on the Work Choice contract provision.  It was therefore decided to de-scope the exit of Remploy ES from the Programme and consider the future of Remploy ES instead as part of the Disability and Health Employment Strategy;
• the original planning assumption was that the exit of the Remploy Automotive business would be financially neutral.  By the time of the forecast, the commercial process was well advanced so an estimate of business sale proceeds was included, based on the offers being considered at that point; and
• the forecast also reflected successful action to mitigate potential customer & supplier contract liabilities.

",The programme handed back £3.8m funding to HMT reducing the budget to £10.2m as this was not required.          ,"The budget provision made for Universal Credit reflects the original funding provided to the Programme in November 2010, as part of the Department’s Spending Review 2010 settlement. 

The reduction in forecast spend reflects the changes in the Programme delivery and migration plans in 2013-14 since the original budget was set. The forecast reflects estimates based on plans/information as at September 2013 - full year expenditure is now estimated to be c£155m.
","2013/14 Budget = £634.2m
2013/14 Forecast = £639.3m

The Work Programme is a Payment by Results programme and therefore costs, and forecasts are subject to change based on the number of people referred onto the Programme, and on the performance of the Programme.  Both referrals and performance have been lower than original business case expectations, but performance has significantly improved since the first year. 
",n/a – variance not more than 5%,"The variance in the Programme forecast for 2013/14 reflects a revision to the implementation timetable and the consequent deferral of some set-up costs, and savings achieved through further scrutiny of requirements.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Departmental narrative on budgeted whole life costs,"The whole life costs cover the DWP and Local Authority costs for implementing and delivering the cap from April 2013.  The costs mainly encompass; DWP Project Team resource, upfront employment support for those claimants potentially being capped (of whom 36,000 accepted employment support and over 19,000 moved into employment), the introduction of a new Benefit Cap IT system to manage the capping of cases, additional LA costs for administering the pathfinder sites from April 2013 and ongoing DWP and LA staff resource for processing cases appropriate to be capped.  ",Whole life costs reflect the total costs associated with the Child Maintenance Reform Programme and remain within 5% variance. ,Programme now complete,As the Programme has developed there have been some changes in scope with the addition of new initiatives and changes in approach to some of the existing projects. It is not anticipated that the overall whole life costs will vary materially from the original budget. ,Costs are within 5% variance.  ,"The budgeted whole life cost of £2,519m includes the investment costs to deliver the new PIP Benefit, developing the IT systems, the costs of Independent Assessment activity by contracted providers, and ongoing costs up to and including 2021/22. ",Whole life costs include the one-off investment costs associated with the exit of Remploy factories from government control and a planning assumption that the savings recycled in to Access to Work in the final year of the current Spending Review period will continue at that level in future years.  The Programme continues to deliver a strong Net Present Value.,The £114m budgeted whole life costs was a very early estimate of the programme investment costs up to 2016/17 which did not include ongoing live running costs. The updated business case will include whole life programme costs to 2022/23. ,The Universal Credit Business Case and whole life costs will be updated to reflect the results of ‘test and learn’ and the progressive development of plans for later years.,"Work Programme budgets vary automatically in relation to the number of claimants referred to the programme, and the levels of performance achieved.

Forecast costs for the whole life of the programme are currently £2,727m.
","Whole life costs cover the costs of the project team, Jobcentre Plus delivery costs, External Provider fees and Wage Incentive Pilots.",The whole life costs cover the period from 2007/08 through to 2017/18.

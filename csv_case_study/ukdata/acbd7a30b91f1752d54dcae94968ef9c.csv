#### (1) and (2) Semi-integrated activities are considered as non-agricultural activities that are semi-independent of the farm business. That is those that still make use of the farm’s resources but have a separate existence. These can usually be distinguished from integrated non-agricultural activities by the presence of one or more of the following: (i) separate bank account; (ii) separate or different management; (iii) separate tax accounts; (iv) own VAT number; )v) separate internal book-keeping. In many financial and management accounts integrated and semi-integrated activities are combined. Accounts differ from business to business in terms of what if anything is included with non-agricultural activities that are only semi-integrated. It is mainly down to the judgement of the accountant or consultant or farmer taking into consideration the scale and nature of the activity.####,,,,,

Notes:,"General Quality Assessment (GQA) Scheme assesses the basic chemical quality of rivers and canals based on three determinands - dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and ammoniacal nitrogen. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"GQA is used to assess chemical quality of rivers and canals across England and Wales at 7,000 sites representing 40,000 kilometres of fresh waters since 1990.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"GQA grades river stretches into six categories (A - F) of chemical quality and these in turn have been grouped into four broader groups - good, fair, poor and bad.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

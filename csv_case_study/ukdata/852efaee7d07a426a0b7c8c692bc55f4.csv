"1 Gifts should not normally be accepted. The only exceptions are those which would normally be considered as isolated trivial gifts eg low value items that can be used or displayed in the workplace such as office stationery or mouse mats or inexpensive seasonal gifts such as diaries and calendars. The acceptance of gifts which are valued about £25 should be declared and recorded by the Head of Department or Office. Gifts which cannot be refused without causing offence for example a picture or an ornament must be accepted “on behalf of the department”, making it clear that it is not being accepted as a personal gift. Such gifts must be kept within the department and displayed in a general area."
"2 Does not normally include attendance at functions hosted by HM Government; ‘diplomatic’ functions in the UK or abroad, hosted by overseas governments; minor refreshments at meetings, receptions, conferences, and seminars; and offers of hospitality which were declined"

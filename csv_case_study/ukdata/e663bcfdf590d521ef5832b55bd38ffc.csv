"Description / Aims 
","The One Click Programme of work is made up of 6 projects; Start-up hub, the Tax Dashboard, the Online Tax Registration Service (Registration Wizard), iforms, Transaction Monitoring and VAT Registration Transformation. One Click brings many Tax services (CT, ITSA, VAT and PAYE) that businesses need together in one place, online. Focuses on key events in a business' lifecycle, with information for pre-start ups, a single place to register for business taxes and a self serve facility to view and update details online.

(N.B., the iforms project has now moved into the Digital Solutions Portfolio.)","The Organised Crime Project will have a significant impact on the Organised Crime segment of HMRC’s Customer-Centric Strategy.  The key aim is to prevent, disrupt and reduce deliberate, systematic and large scale attacks by Organised Criminal Groups (OCGs), estimated to cost HMRC between £5bn to £7bn per annum. The threat from OCGs is evolving and we need to prevent significant attempted fraud just to maintain losses at their current level. The project will deploy approximately 500 FTEs across a range of new and established interventions to target organised criminals including; joint working with the Border Force (BF), the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and expanding our Fiscal Crime Liaison Officer (FCLO) Network to increase cooperation with foreign administrations. We are also an instrumental part of the Cross Government Strategy to tackle Cyber Crime. We aim to address the threats at each stage of the illicit ‘supply chain,’ improving capabilities in intelligence, civil and criminal investigations. The Project is structured to address the main threats which come from VAT Missing Trader Intra-Community (MTIC), repayment and registration fraud, diverted alcohol products and cigarette and tobacco smuggling. 
During 2012-15 we will change our approach to organised crime to target the key individuals behind the fraud using new intelligence gathering methods 
and new technology capabilities that will support this approach.","Use of SR10 reinvestment monies to increase the capacity and capability of trained tax professionals and operational people engaged in tax compliance work, and widen the range of approaches and interventions they use. To use reinvestment funds of £553m to deliver £6.66b benefits by increasing capacity in Enforcement & Compliance (E&C) and building its capability by shifting resource into high risks including evasion.  This will be achieved using HMRC's Customer Centric Business Strategy.  The outcome will be more resource focused on tackling risks in the rule breakers and potential rule breakers segments using new and innovative ways to settle those risks.  The project has six distinct strands:
1.  Redeployment of additional resource within Local Compliance & Risk & Intelligence Service to evasion and other risks - Local Compliance will be the recipient of the majority of the Wider Coverage reinvestment resources to increase its capability and capacity. Rick & Intelligence Service will grow also as a consequence to feed Local Compliance's increased needs for risk assessments. 
2.  Specialist Investigation Redeployment - as a result of the increase in capacity and focus on tackling evasion and non compliance SI has launched   .
a unit to tackle off shore evasion.
3.  Tackling evasion risks through E&C Taskforces - the programme will deliver the resource capacity and capability to tackle rule breaking and 
evasion by establishing E&C Taskforces.
4.  Tackling risks through campaigns - the programme will fund additional staff so that the number of campaigns launched over the SR period will 
increase.
5.  Tackling risks through pre-return Business Records Checks - this will address the problem of poor record keeping at source using a pro-active 
approach. 
6.  Tackling recidivism through the managing the Serious Defaulters Scheme - E&C intends to put additional effort in monitoring rule breakers 
post intervention.

Current HM Treasury approval status is at FBC. The Programme FBC has been given full approval by HMRC Investment Committee. The HMRC 
Treasury Approval point for the FBC took place on 20 November 2012.","This investment of staff represents the continuation of our existing operations, but increases the resource deployed on debt collection by 909 FTE over the proposed SR10 reduced resource baseline. Benefits are calculated against the SR10 reduced resource baseline as the counterfactual.  
Investing staff back into our more efficient and effective debt collection model results in additional receipts in the consolidated fund of £1108m over the SR10. 
Even with this investment, DMB will deliver a 9% net FTE reduction across the SR10 period as well as the additional receipts detailed above.
The majority of investment (£56.3m) is paybill with a small amount of capital and resource to enable the transfer of staff into DMB. Operational planning with this investment scenario has demonstrated no scale up costs elsewhere.","HMRC is revising its approach to tackling fraud in the Rule Breakers customer group, increasing the number of criminal investigations and subsequent prosecutions in this group. This approach is called Volume Crime and will: deter rule breakers and potential rule breakers from fraudulent behaviour; enhance the effectiveness of civil interventions by evidencing the downsides of non-compliance; and show HMRC is relentless in pursuit of those who break the rules.  The Volume Crime project aims to significantly increase productivity and resources deployed to criminal investigation. 240 staff years will be deployed as a result of this project in Criminal Investigation and associated Risk and Intelligence Service functions, with prosecution numbers rising through the SR10 period to an additional 1,000 prosecutions delivered per year from 2014/15. The considerable increase in activity in the rule breakers segment increases the perceived risks to potential rule  breakers and thus deters individuals from going down the path of tax evasion and therefore an increase in ""voluntary compliance"" due to the deterrent effect. 
The project is currently creating a research programme to measure this deterrent effect.",Real Time Information is the next stage of improving PAYE through the use of real time information.  It will deliver a series of projects to implement measures designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the PAYE system.  This will underpin the introduction by the Department for Work and Pensions of the Universal Credit regime.,"This investment to extend the use of Debt Collection Agencies  represents a continuation and expansion of our existing operations. (Departmental funding restrictions had meant there would be no DCA activity planned beyond 2010/11 without investment.)  It provides additional debt collection capability and capacity to allow more debts to be tackled quicker and more effectively, change the behaviours of more customers and generate more revenue.","HMRC's Digital Portfolio will deliver new and enhanced existing online services for Individuals, Business customers and the agent community.  The Programme will support the delivery of HMRC's Digital Strategy and the introduction of the Cabinet Office new Identity Assurance Strategy by delivering:
- HMRC's four Exemplar Digital Services - PAYE Online, Digital SA, Tax for My Business, Agents Online 
- Underpinning digital capability that will provide HMRC with the capability to respond at pace to change, including the introduction of iforms
- New IDA process through PAYE Online and our Corporate solution for business customers "
Departmental commentary on actions planned or taken on the MPA RAG rating.,The majority of the projects have now delivered but a final version of the programme’s full business case is planned for completion and approval by HMRC’s Investment Committee in October 2013.,There is uncertainty in delivery of benefits amongst a number of major strands. A recommended revised full business case is under production.,"Whilst there is progress in programme delivery there are challenges in meeting programme closure requirements, understanding Spending Review 2013 impacts, and ensuring that the Spending Review 2010 obligations continue to be met.",Benefit delivery is ahead of profile and the project is ready to move into business as usual subject to formal closedown procedures which are underway.,All staff recruitment and training has been completed and the first strand of the project completed in February 2013.,"Following the successful commencement of main migration in April 2013 migration delivery is ahead of expectations; however there remain a number of challenges in including migrating the remaining PAYE schemes onto RTI, and bringing on board some of the very largest schemes by 5 October 2013.  There remains a key focus on the work to successfully deliver all critical business change activity including the work to prepare for the implementation of the October 2013 and April 2014 IT releases",No major concerns around achievement of targets. The Amber-Green rating reflects that there are some potential small managed concerns on the deliverables within the programme.,The portfolio continues to break new ground in terms of the introduction of Agile delivery methods into an organisation with established Waterfall delivery processes.

"DFE-1157","N/D","SCS1","Deputy Director","This post provides analysis and evidence to all IFD, leading professional analysts from four disciplines (economists / statistician / social researchers / operational researchers). On education funding, this includes financial modelling to allocate funding to LAs for maintained schools and to calculate the budgets for individual Academies. Additionally we model affordability, develop funding methodologies (e.g. Pupil Premium, Fair Funding Formula), and monitor how this funding is budgeted and account for how it is spent. Similar roles exist for post-16 learning routes and for Capital Funding. We also provide statistical analysis to project and plan the rate of Academies expansion; report on Academies’ educational standards; assess demand for Free Schools, UTCs and Studio Schools; and, generate performance indicators for IFD. We articulate the economic rationale for policy reform and explain the value for money in ministerial recommendations. Finally, we provide research evidence review and synthesis, policy evaluation and produce and analyse the Department’s longitudinal data on the lives of young people.","Department for Education","Department For Education","Education Funding Group","0370 000 2288","N/D","DFE-1124","1899402","1.00","N/A","N/A","","Programme and Project Management (PPM)","","1"

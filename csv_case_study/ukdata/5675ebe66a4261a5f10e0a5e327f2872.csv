"All investments in IFIs are classified as 'available for sale' financial assets, as they do not meet the criteria for the other categories of financial assets specified in IAS 39. There is currently no intention to sell any of the investments shown above other than those classified within Current Financial Assets.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
Public Sector Bodies,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"DFID, on behalf of the Government, owns 100% of the issued ordinary share capital of CDC Group plc.  In 2004, fund management activities previously carried out by CDC were transferred to a newly formed limited liability partnership (Actis LLP).  As a result DFID, on behalf of the Government, owned 40% of the members capital of Actis LLP.  ",,,,,,,,
"In accordance with the FReM, investments in public corporations falling outside the resource accounting boundary, such as CDC and Actis LLP, are recognised at historical cost less any impairment.   Impairments are assessed by comparing the historic cost to DFID's share of net assets, with any impairment being taken to the statement of comprehensive net expenditure.",,,,,,,,
"HMT further requires that self financing public corporations achieve a rate of return, described as ""cost of capital"" to ensure that the opportunity cost of departments' investments is covered.  If the corporation does not meet its rate of return over each CSR period, then the shareholding department may face a further charge to the extent that such a return has not been met.",,,,,,,,
During CSR period 2008-2010 both Actis and CDC met their HMT determined rate of return and as a result no underperformance charge was levied.  ,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
International financial institutions ,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"Investments in International Financial Institutions (IFIs) are valued at fair value.  There is no market in these investments - all shareholders are sovereign states.  Fair value has been assessed as DFID's share of the net assets of the IFI, based on the number of shares subscribed by DFID.  The Articles of Agreement of all the IFIs specify that this is the value that DFID would receive on the dissolution of the IFI.",,,,,,,,
"All investments in IFIs are denominated in a currency other then sterling.  DFID is therefore exposed to currency risk if the value of these currencies was to fall against sterling.  DFID is also exposed to market risk, as the value of each investment is dependent upon the net assets of the IFI.",,,,,,,,
Base currencies of investments in International Financial Institutions are shown below.  $(US) figures include those bodies for which US$ are used as the working equivalent for units of account formally expressed in Special Drawing Rights (SDR). Revaluations for IFIs include £55 million (net) of unrealised losses (2010-11: losses of £117 million) arising from changes in exchange rates.,,,,,,,,

"Bilateral loans, and loans formerly managed by Actis, are made directly with sovereign states; multilateral loans are made with sovereign states through multilateral bodies such as the European Investment Bank.  Assessments of credit risk are based on default history, political risks, and the potential future granting of debt relief.",,,,,,,,
"Credit risk on the Department's cash balances held at Government Banking Service is considered to be very low.  Imprest balances are held with various institutions, all of which are major global banks with high credit ratings.",,,,,,,,

14.7 Market risk,,,,,,,,
Interest rate risk,,,,,,,,
"The Department's interest rate risk arises primarily from loans made at a floating rate, and cash balances held overseas.  Neither of these represent a significant source of income for the Department - total income from such sources in 2011-12 amounted to £1.2m (2010-11 £5.1m).  A 0.75% change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, would have a 0.001% (£0.1m) impact on net operating costs.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
Foreign currency risk,,,,,,,,
"The Department's largest exposure in terms of net assets is in US dollar and Euro.  On the statement of financial position, exchange gains on investments are taken to the revaluation reserve.  Exchange losses are also charged to the revaluation reserve where a previously accumulated reserve is available; losses in excess of this reserve are charged to operating costs.  As at 31 March 2012, £2,150m (2011 £2,031m) of the Department's investments were denominated in US dollars and £989k (2011 £989k) in Euros.  Exchange gains and losses on other financial assets and liabilities are charged to operating costs and are minimal based on the composition of assets and liabilities in foreign currency.",,,,,,,,
"At 31 March 2012, if sterling had weakened by 10% against the US dollar, with all other variables held constant, net assets would have decreased by £239.1m (2011 £225.7m).  Net operating costs would have reduced by £286k (2011 £158k).  At the same date if sterling had weakened by 10% against the Euro, with all other variables held constant, net assets would have decreased by £110k (2011 £110k) with no impact on the operating costs.",,,,,,,,
"During the year under review DFID did enter into arrangements to mitigate its exposure to currency risk on a large programme denominated in South African Rand where forward contracts were purchased to match milestone payments.  At 31 March 2012 note 14.2 shows unrealised losses of £3.6m, which were charged to operating costs during 2011-12.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
Other price risk,,,,,,,,
"The Department's investments in IFIs are based on share of the net assets of each IFI.  Although there is no public traded market for these investments, changes in the underlying net asset values of the IFIs would impact on the investment value shown in these accounts.  As at 31 March 2012, a 10% reduction in net asset values of the IFIs, with all other variables held constant, would result in the Department's net assets being reduced by £328.8m (2011 £310.1m).  ",,,,,,,,
"Investments in CDC and Actis are shown at the lower of historic cost or market value.  Where market value is lower this will be historic cost less any impairment to take to this value.  As at 31 March 2012, a 10% reduction in the net asset value of these organisations, with all other variables held constant, would not have any effect on either the Department's net assets, or net operating costs (2011 nil).  This is because market value is in excess of historic cost.",,,,,,,,

SFA undertook a review of its office locations and ICT services which it provides to its core & non-core offices.    The exact number of offices and types of ICT Service will be confirmed prior to contract award.
Procurement will be undertaken to ensure flexibility in terms of service configuration and it will be made clear to potential bidders that volumes are subject to change as a result of the review. Procurement will be undertaken using the Government Digital Marketplace; this allows the SFA to contract for two years with the option to terminate earlier. 
Current Telephony Services contract was procured in 2011 for a 4 year term and expires at the end of December 2015.  The contract therefore needs to be re-procured to ensure business continuity from December 2015 onwards.","£990,000","£990,000",22/09/2015

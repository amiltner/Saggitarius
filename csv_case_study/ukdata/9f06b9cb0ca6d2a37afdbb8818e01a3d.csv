"Description / Aims 
(From GMPP data)","ICT contracts for the department are due to expire in November 2015.  This programme is to provide for continuity of operations for ICT services for the CPS beyond Nov 2015. The plan is that the CGI Compass contract will be extended to the end of Mar 2017. The contract will be renegotiated with the Print Services and the Networks and Telephony Services removed from Nov 2015 and Mar 2016 respectively. These services will then be procured through pan-government frameworks (PSN Connectivity, PSN Services and Print Services) prior to removal from the Compass contract. The programme will manage the necessary procurements, contract agreements and service transitions. ",,

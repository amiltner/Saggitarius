Description / aims,This project oversees the re-tendering exercise of the Escorting and Travel contracts. The Escorting contract is for the secure escorting of detainees within the UK and the Travel contract is for the supply of airline tickets for overseas removals.,"The objective of the SOCA Catalyst Programme is to secure, by 31 March 2012, an integrated physical infrastructure capable of sustaining delivery of our business outcomes, improving operational performance, value for money, recruitment, retention and career development paths.",The overall aim of COMPASS project is to provide contract provision for accommodation and related services for eligible applicants  beyond the current arrangements which are due to expire in 2012 with improved terms and conditions whilst maintaining value for money.  The project focuses on the delivery of the procurement and change management of current services to new commercial contracts. Delivery of the benefits is now subject to operational and commercial delivery management and reporting. ,"Extend and Blend is a Home Office programme to move the department to a new restricted IT infrastructure and service arrangements, covering around 25,000 users. The programme aims to cut costs by over a quarter, modernise and join up IT services to staff, introduce greater resilience, mobility and flexibility, and put in place a strategic platform for the future development of the department's IT in line with the Government's ICT Strategy.  
"," IABS is used to record, store and match biometric information from visa applicants, asylum seekers requiring registration cards, individuals applying for biometric residence permits, and all fingerprints taken for immigration purposes.","The ICW Programme is a business-led change programme with the objective of supporting the Home Office and the former UK Border Agency in achieving their strategic objectives, through the delivery of a world-class case working capability.","The programme’s mandate, as set out in the 2005 Bichard progress report, is to deliver an effective, integrated, national, regional and local information sharing and intelligence capability which will improve the ability of the police and partner agencies to proactively use information for intelligence purposes to:
- Prevent crime;
- Bring offenders to justice;
- Safeguard children and vulnerable people; and
- Professionalise the investigation process. 
","The programme delivered the procurement of a new supplier for a new, more secure passport design, production and integrated centralised personalisation of around 5 million passports a year. Additionally, the Regional Office Printing Equipment project enabled local personalisation of the new passport at IPS regional offices for up to 400,000 premium customers a year.","The project will ensure that International Operations and Visa Group has contracted commercial partners who will undertake key and specified functions as part of the visa process from 1 April 2014 and which enables the Group to meet its obligations to secure the border, provide good customer service in support of the UK Government’s growth agenda and meet our Spending Review obligations.  ","The SOCA ISOT Programme is replacing multiple existing ICT contracts with one contract which will enable the necessary step-change in SOCA’s capacity and capability to make a difference in the world of serious organised crime and its harmful impact on the public, by contracting for and modernising to an effective, efficient, managed ICT delivery capability.","The purpose of the project is to retender for the provision of secure accommodation for detained immigration offenders at Colnbrook and Harmondsworth, ensuring any change of contractor is mobilised effectively prior to the expiry of the existing contract.  Previously these adjacent Immigration Removal Centres have been run by separate contractors, and this project will commercially combine the two centres enabling operational benefits and financial savings.",The purpose of this project is to oversee the establishment of the College of Policing by December 2012.,"The main aim of the Emergency Services Mobile Communications Programme (ESMCP) is to deliver mobile voice and data communications services to the emergency services, other public safety organisations and potentially other public sector bodies.  The services to be provided under this programme will replace, but are not exclusive to, those delivered under existing contract(s) such as Airwave.","The programme is responsible for creating the National Crime Agency (NCA) – a key priority for the Home Secretary which will deliver a step change improvement in the UK’s response to serious, organised and complex crime.","The Communications Capabilities Development programme (CCD programme) brings together work to ensure that, in a changing communications environment, communications data and interception of communications can continue to protect the public and save lives.

Our ongoing programme reflects the vital role communications data plays in investigating and prosecuting serious crimes such as child sex abuse, kidnap, murder and drug related crime, as well as in public protection – such as locating missing persons.
 ","In July 2011, the Home Secretary announced a fundamental reform to the way ICT is managed in the police forces with the establishment of a police-led ICT company.
The reform is aimed at achieving four strategic objectives:
1. To free chief officers and police staff to focus on fighting crime and making their communities safer
2. To provide the British police service with more effective and innovative ICT support
3. To improve value for money from ICT services 
4. To ensure services and products support forces and other customers in their drive for interoperability.
","The Application & Enrolment Contract let to Computer Science Corporation in April 2009 (and reset in October 2010) includes the provision of Information Technology Outsourcing Services and a transformation programme to deliver:                                                       i) More robust, integrated, secure and cost effective technical infrastructure to support IPS business operations, including networks and telephony.  
(ii) A Customer Application Management System (AMS) to replace PASS and a new Online Application Channel for passport applicants in the UK and overseas.
",The Disclosure & Barring Service Programme is a change programme established to modernise and improve the disclosure and barring services previously delivered by the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) and the Independent Safeguarding Authority - and now delivered by the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS). ,"The second generation Schengen Information System (SIS II) will routinely provide UK Law Enforcement Agencies with real-time data on wanted and missing persons, as well as lost and stolen objects from across 31 participating states.  SIS II will deliver several key strategic benefits on behalf of the Home Office, police forces and the wider criminal justice sector:
Reduced crime – particularly via the ability to screen for wanted criminals via border controls
Greater identity assurance at the border
Improved public and law enforcement officer protection
Improved judicial cooperation across the Schengen Area
Improved Police co-operation across the Schengen Area. ","The e-Borders Programme will create an integrated, secure border for the 21st century.  The programme contains project portfolios aimed at establishing a modernised, intelligence-led immigration control framework, counter-terrorism support and criminality detection.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Departmental narrative, actions on Delivery Confidence Assessment",The contracts are delivering business case benefits including savings and improved delivery. Further work is in progress to generate additional savings and ensure enhanced/consistent delivery.,"The SOCA Catalyst Programme closed following successful delivery as scheduled and business change activity is being undertaken as part of the work to establish the National Crime Agency.
",These contracts are in place and are operating as part of Business As Usual.,"The new systems have now been rolled out to the user community of around 25,000 users.   Functionality continues to be enhanced during the final stages of the programme. The programme has successfully cut costs by over 25%. ",The programme delivered to schedule and the capability operated effectively as part of the Olympic security arrangements.,"The programme has successfully delivered an online student application process.  Depending on the business requirement, future releases will develop the other tiers on this common model, reusing data wherever applicable. This is a significant step on the route to deliver a Single Case Working Model for the Home Office.",The programme has delivered well to date with volumes of data uploaded far exceeding initial estimates. ,The capability is now operating as Business As Usual.,The programme has now taken account of the additional requirements for interviewing and an internal review has suggested improvements to planning to facilitate management of the programme's tight timescales.,"A Risk Mitigation based re-plan of the Contract is underway following  intervention by the SOCA Board. This has led to a revision of programme plans, more realistic delivery timescales and improved joint working arrangements between the supplier and SOCA. The Home Office and the Cabinet Office have provided support and direction so that SOCA's capability to deliver the programme has been strengthened and both of these stakeholders continue to provide additional programme level assurance to the programme leader.  Contract scope and financial controls are being adhered to.  



",This project is on schedule and should achieve economies of scale savings over existing arrangements.,The project to establish the College of Policing was delivered successfully to schedule.  The College began providing services to police forces in England and Wales on 3 December 2012 and is operating within its planned budgets.,,The programme is now firmly focused on delivery and revised programme management arrangements have been put in place to reflect this. Most of the senior appointments to the NCA have been made and the key Deputy Director General post has been advertised. The Interim NCA Board is now meeting monthly and the Crime and Courts Act received royal assent on 25 April. Shadow working began in April to test new NCA capabilities and robust and regular monitoring and testing of readiness will take place in the run up to the NCA going live in October.,,The rating reflects the successful establishment of the Police ICT Company with the company being incorporated in June 2012.  This has provided the basis for the viable operation of the Company going forward.,The programme is making progress and is in the latter stages of application software delivery.  The contract construct has provided financial protection against delay which will help to deliver the programme within approved envelopes. Issues are specific to the development of the Application Management System; the supplier has performed well in other areas of the broader programme under contract such as managing legacy IT systems.,The programme team is working with the suppliers to develop a robust implementation plan.,The programme has continued to work successfully with diverse stakeholders and to monitor the work being undertaken by the other European states.,The system was upgraded and operated effectively as part of the Olympic security arrangements. Further improvements to the resilience and capabilities of the two core systems are on track for delivery during 2013.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

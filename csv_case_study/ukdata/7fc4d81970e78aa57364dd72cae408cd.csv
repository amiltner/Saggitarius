Appendix
Glossary of key terms
"% positive is the proportion who selected either ""agree"" or ""strongly agree"" for a question"
or all questions within a theme in the case of the theme score % positive
Comparisons to the previous survey relate to the results from the 2011 Civil Service People Survey
Where a question is flagged as changed since the last survey comparisons should be treated with caution as changes to wording may affect how people respond
The CS2012 benchmark is the median percent positive across all organisations that participated in the 2012 Civil Service People Survey
"For each question, the CS High Performers is the upper quartile score across all organisations that have taken part in the 2012 Civil Service People Survey"
Rounding 
"Results are presented as whole numbers for ease of reading, with rounding performed at the last stage of calculation for maximum accuracy"
Statistical significance 
Statistical testing has been carried out on the comparisons between this year's results and your previous survey
CS2012 results and CS High Performers results to identify differences that are statistically significant
You can therefore be confident that the difference represents a real difference in opinion between the results
The employee engagement index 
The survey includes five questions that make up the engagement index (B50-B54)
The index score represents the average level of engagement in that unit and ranges from 0 to 100
An index score of 0 represents all respondents in that unit saying they strongly disagree to all five engagement questions
a score of 100 represents all respondents saying they strongly agree to all five engagement questions
The drivers of engagement 
"While the engagement index shows the average level of engagement, it does not show what you can do to improve engagement"
Nine themes have been included in the survey to measure employees experiences at work
"A statistical technique, stepwise regression, is used to identify the extent to which each of these themes has an association with engagement"
The themes identified as having an association are called the Drivers of engagement
The strength of association with engagement varies by theme and is rated out of 4
Themes rated 4 out of 4 have the strongest association with engagement
Confidentiality 
This survey was carried out as part of the 2012 Civil Service People Survey
This is managed by the Cabinet Office on behalf of all the participating organisations
The Cabinet Office commissioned ORC International to carry out the survey
"ORC International is a member of the Market Research Society, and is bound by their strict code of conduct and confidentiality rules"
These rules do not allow for the breakdown of the results to the extent where the anonymity of individuals may be compromised
Groups of less than 10 respondents will not be reported on
however their responses do contribute to the overall scores for the unit and organisation they belong to and the overall Civil Service results

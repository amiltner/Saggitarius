"""Policy on acceptance, registering and retention of gifts:""",,,,
"""Diaries, calendars and other small items of modest value bearing a company’s name or insignia can be accepted and do not need to be reported. All other gifts from individuals, organisations (including foreign governments and organisations) and companies to employees must be refused or returned to the donor unless refusal would cause offence or misunderstanding.  In such circumstances the gift must be registered and may be put on display in the office; if the gift is perishable, it may be used within the division involved at the discretion of the Head of Unit. In such circumstances for gifts from foreign governments and organisations, the gift must be registered and HR will then decide whether the gift should be disposed for sale to the benefit of the Exchequer or retained in the Department and where appropriate retained for display on some future occasion as a mark of politeness.""",,,,

Notes:,-1,Three licences in 2003 re-assigned to 'Other industry' from 'Electricity supply' ,,,,,,,,,
,-2,No returns received for private water supply licences in 2002 and 2003 led to over estimate in figures,,,,,,,,,
,-3,Increased number of returns in 2004 received for fish farming licences in South Wessex Area,,,,,,,,,
,-4,Reduced hydropower abstraction in 2005,,,,,,,,,
,-5,Reduced hydropower abstraction in 2005,,,,,,,,,
,-6,Several licences changed in 2006 from surface water to tidal,,,,,,,,,
,-7,Reduced actual abstraction in 2008 in Thames region for mineral/extractive industry and reduction in one significant licence,,,,,,,,,
,-8,Reduced mechanical non-electrical power abstraction in 2010,,,,,,,,,
,-9,Over estimate of actual abstraction in 2007 for agriculture in South West Region,,,,,,,,,
,-10,Increase in actuals received in 2008 for hydropower in Midlands Region,,,,,,,,,
,-11,80% reduction in usage of hydroelectric power at one station,,,,,,,,,
,-12,Over estimate of actual abstraction in 2010 for Other Industry (Thames Region),,,,,,,,,
,-13,"From 1 April 2011 EA Thames and EA Southern merged to form EA South East. The two regions are still shown separately as this is the basis of the WR charges scheme, this is reflected by  the underlying reference information used to prepare ABSTAT.",,,,,,,,,
,b ,Indicates a break in the series where information concerning abstractions in the country of England and the Dee/Wye regional charge areas (formerly the Wales regional charge area) has been amalgamated into the North West and Midlands regional charge areas respectively,,,,,,,,,

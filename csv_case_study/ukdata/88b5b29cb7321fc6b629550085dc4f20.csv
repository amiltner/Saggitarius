Table 2. Overview of potential indicators,,

,Indicator required for analysis,Dataset and variable identified,Assessment of fitness for purpose
,Participation,"ILR (Number of Learner Responsive Learners, Number of Learner Responsive Learners excluding franchised and long distance learners, Number of LSC / Skills Funding Agency funded learner responsive learners)","Category 2 - available ILR data contained variables of relevance but idiosyncracies, inconsistencies and missing information meant specific data needed to be verified, edited and/or completed by colleges"
,Success rates,NSRT (Proportion of students achieving),Category 1 - available NSRT data was fit for purpose
,Retention rates,NSRT (Proportion of students completing),Category 1 - available NSRT data was fit for purpose
,Achievement rates ,NSRT (Proportion of learning aims completed),Category 1 - available NSRT data was fit for purpose
,Number of apprentices trained by colleges ,ILR [Number of Employer Responsive Learners) ,"Category 2 - available ILR data contained variables of relevance but idiosyncracies, inconsistencies and missing information meant specific data needed to be verified, edited and/or completed by colleges"
,College ability to generate fee income,"College Financial Records (tuition fee income, LSC / Skills Funding Agency income, total income)","Category 2 - available College Financial Records data contained variables of relevance but idiosyncracies, inconsistencies and missing information meant specific data needed to be verified, edited and/or completed by colleges"
,Amount of capital expenditure and dates,"Capital expenditure records (project number, project description, date of approval, date of completion, total cost of project (initial projection), total cost of project (ex post))","Category 2 - available capital expenditure records contained variables of relevance but idiosyncracies, inconsistencies and missing information meant specific data needed to be verified, edited and/or completed by colleges"
,Ability to engage with employers ,ILR (Proportion of learners employed and released by employer to learn),Category 3 - available ILR data not adequately capturing employer engagement. Decision taken that this was better explored through the qualitative case studies.
,Learner satisfaction with learning environment and experience,NLSS,Category 3 - available NLSS data not generally reported at college level as sample sizes too small for results to be considered robust. Decision taken that this was better explored through the qualitative case studies.
,Wider impacts on the local economy,-,Category 3 - no suitable variable identified. Decision taken that this was better explored through the qualitative case studies.
,On and off site GLH,ILR (GLH for FE learners (not apprentices) ,Category 3 - no suitable variable identified to make an appropriate on and off site split. Decision taken that this variable should be excluded from analysis.
,Capital estate condition and impact of not investing ,"EMandate (Breakdown of estate into category A, B,C and D)","Category 3 - suitable variables identified but issues with coverage and reliability at the beginning and end points of the time period. On balance, decision taken to explore this variable through the qualitative case studies rather than making the census template too cumbersome."
,Environmental sustainability,"EMandate (NIA, electricity consumption, energy costs)","Category 3 - suitable variables identified but issues with coverage and reliability at the beginning and end points of the time period. On balance, decision taken to explore this variable through the qualitative case studies rather than making the census template too cumbersome."
,Staff recruitment and retention ,"SIR (recruitment - N/A, retention - proportion of all staff still employed at year end)","Category 3 - Recruitment - deriving a recruitment variable is problematic from a conceptual perspective. We want to know whether capital expenditure has made it easier for a college to recruit but the observed recruitment rate will reflect a combination of factors (i) effort undertaken to recruit (ii) replacing lost staff - if capital expenditure improves retention, fewer vacancies would need filling (iii) changes to staffing requirements - capex could increase the scale of the college. Decision taken to explore within case studies. Retention - variable identified in SIR but idiosyncracies observed in the variable over time. On balance, decision taken to explore this variable through the case studies rather than making the census template too cumbersome."
,Efficiency and estate rationalisation,-,Category 3 - no suitable variable identified. Decision taken that this variable should be excluded from analysis. Unlikely that this measure specifically collected in the context of a capital expenditure project and wanted to ensure that searching for this information did not have a negative impact on case study overall.

,"Note 1. APHA (formerly AHVLA ) 37 of the AO's are temporary workers to deal with temporary increases in work. 16 are for longer term or permanent recruitments in Operational roles. 13 of 15 EO roles are Operational and the other 2 within Finance. The 16 SEO roles are all frontline Veterinary roles.

,"Note 2. Environment Agency (EA) The frontline and business critical roles are required for delivery of our corporate objectives including but not limited to flood risk management and flood management technical resilience, processing of environmental permits, river water quality improvements, and regulatory responsibilities such as waste management.  There has been a 347% uplift in the rate of approvals shown in this return when compared with that of last quarter.  This corresponds with figures reported to Environment Agency Executive Directors and is predominantly due to work programme extensions and on-going Strategic Review Response Programme. This Programme calls for a significant amount of staff movement internally.

The delays in confirming permanent roles for staff means that we have had to extend more contingent / temporary workers until the end of the financial year, than planned. This has meant more approval requests.

The permanent / contingent split was 19% permanent and 81%  contingent.

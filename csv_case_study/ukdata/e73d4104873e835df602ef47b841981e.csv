"Description / Aims 
","In a world of internet enabled communication, to ensure that the police, wider law enforcement, security and intelligence agencies can lawfully obtain, manage and use communications data and intercepted content to: detect, prevent and disrupt crime; protect the public and save lives.","To provide ongoing contract provision for accommodation and transport services to eligible asylum applicants throughout the UK beyond the arrangements which expired in 2012 with improved terms and conditions, whilst maintaining value for money.  ","To implement reviews of the Criminal Records Regime (CRR) and the Vetting and Barring Scheme (VBS) that reported in February 2011.  This includes the merger and replacement of the CRB and the ISA by a single new organisation, the Disclosure and Barring Service responsible for delivery of the disclosure and barring functions, and the development of a new portable disclosure service for individuals, employers and voluntary bodies.","To continue to provide secure accommodation for detained persons at the Colnbrook and Harmondsworth Immigration Removal Centres ensuring that any change of contractor is mobilised effectively prior to the expiry of the existing contract on 31 August 2014, with the new contract to run for 8 years, with options for a further 3 years.  ","IABS built a central biometric capability to replace the Immigration and Asylum Fingerprint System (IAFS). IABS was required because the IAFS legacy system was 10 years old and running out of capacity.   IABS went live on 27 February 2012 and is fully operational.  A subsequent release, in April 2013, supported biometric verification with higher availability and greater resilience, and enabled the capability to hold fingerprint and facial watch-lists.  
","To deliver an effective, integrated, national, regional and local information sharing and intelligence capability which will improve the ability of the police and partner agencies to proactively use information for intelligence purposes to:
- Prevent crime;
- Bring offenders to justice;
- Safeguard children and vulnerable people; and
- Professionalise the investigation process. 
","To create the National Crime Agency (NCA) which will deliver a step change improvement in the UK’s response to serious and organised crime.  The NCA will be a UK wide crime-fighting agency which will have a highly visible, national profile dedicated to protecting the public. The legislation provides for the NCA to have a wide, joined up remit to tackle organised crime, strengthen UK borders, fight fraud and cyber crime and protect children and young people from sexual abuse and exploitation. It will work collaboratively with law enforcement agencies and wider partners to ensure that those that commit serious, organised and complex crime are tracked down, pursued and bought to justice, their groups and activity disrupted; and their criminal gains stripped away.","To ensure that UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) has contracted commercial partners to undertake key and specified functions as part of the end to end visa process from 1 April 2014 and enable UKVI to meet its obligations to secure the border, to provide good customer service in support of the UK Government’s growth agenda and meet Spending Review obligations. ","In July 2011, the Home Secretary announced a fundamental reform to the way ICT is managed in the police forces with the establishment of a police-led ICT company.
The reform is aimed at achieving four strategic objectives:
1. To free chief officers and police staff to focus on fighting crime and making their communities safer
2. To provide the British police service with more effective and innovative ICT support
3. To improve value for money from ICT services 
4. To ensure services and products support forces and other customers in their drive for interoperability.","SISII exchanges information on persons and objects wanted for law enforcement purposes. It enables the participating Member States to better combat domestic and transnational crime, protect the border and strengthen public protection. It also extends the reach of law enforcement across Europe through enhanced information sharing and increased operational effectiveness. ","To improve customer service and cost of operations. To replace outdated infrastructure for increased resilience and to replace existing Passport Application Support System (PASS) with a new system for processing passport applications, to minimise support cost, both of which support the ability to issue passports reliably. The new system for processing passport applications is called Application Management System (AMS). 

",To expand Tinsley House Immigration Removal Centre to provide about 150 additional beds plus healthcare and ancillary services.,"The two primary aims of this programme are to:
- Deliver modern, cost effective, resilient and interoperable mobile voice and data services as required by operational elements of the emergency services, with appropriate levels of confidentiality for the traffic carried fit for purpose for at least the period 2020 - 2030; and 
- Ensure a smooth transition from Airwave to the new service(s).  ","To create an integrated, secure border for the 21st century.  The Programme contains a portfolio of projects aimed at establishing a modernised, intelligence-led immigration control framework, counter-terrorism support and criminality detection. "
Departmental commentary on actions planned or taken on the MPA RAG rating.,"The Programme was rated Amber/Red due to uncertainty around Communications Data legislative proposals and potential issues with long term affordability.  The Programme has, however, re-focused effort under existing legislation and has re-scoped accordingly taking forward work with stakeholders in priority areas.","The department has taken action to improve delivery and reduce the asylum budget. These include 
- More efficient processes, increasing resources and targets; 
- Increased collaboration with providers and external stakeholders; 
- New and focused customer service targets; and 
- Action plans to take forward recommendations from the recent audits and reviews.?
",A revised plan to achieve transition to the new service provider was developed and successfully implemented so that service was transferred on 12 March 2014.  Ownership of the Programme has now also transferred from the Home Office to the Disclosure and Barring Service which has established strong governance arrangements to take forward work on service modernisation.,"The mobilisation phase of this project has been compressed due to delays in securing the necessary approvals.  Nevertheless, our operator states that they can still mobilise prior to 1 September 2014 and we are working closely with them to facilitate this.  At present, actions progressed suggest that this timescale will be achieved although contingency is tight.","The Immigration and Asylum Biometric System (IABS) system was successfully delivered on 27 February 2012, it is operational and has replaced IAFS as the former UKBA’s biometric system. The programme also delivered the required capability for biometrics capture for Games Family Members at the 2012 Games.

IABS project also delivered the Strategic Biometric Verification solution and Watch list Core functionality in April 2013. This capacity will Support Biometric Verification with higher availability and greater resilience.  It will also add additional dedicated software and hardware to provide resilience and improved response speed.

A final review  of the project concluded that IABS has been delivered successfully and is functioning to users’ full satisfaction. The business case has been achieved and the benefits are being realised.
","The programme has uploaded far more data than was initially expected by this stage.  The new capability is making a practical difference to the police in identifying serious criminals and is also being used by the National Crime Agency.  Remaining work is focused on ensuring that final ""snags"" are addressed by the supplier which led to the delivery confidence rating at quarter 2.  Intensive work has been undertaken as a result of the rating to ensure the programme completed its full functionality.   The most significant issue has now been resolved.  ","The National Crime Agency launched successfully as planned in October 2013.   For the first time, the NCA brings together a single strategic intelligence picture, equipping the whole law enforcement community to better identify, and respond to threats and vulnerabilities. In particular, the NCA is focusing on the relentless disruption of high priority and priority criminals and their groups and has developed strong two-way links with UK police forces, and other UK operational partners.  It has already launched successful operations to tackle child abuse in the Philippines leading to 17 arrests in the UK; the arrest of criminals wanted in the UK in Spain; and the tackling of a Romanian based gang involved in child trafficking in the UK.","The programme remains on track to ensure that the NGOV contract goes live on 1 April 2014. The UKVI International Operational Regions with the support of a central HQ project team are currently managing transition to the new contract with the 2 commercial partners.  Contingencies are in place for any locations that are identified as at risk of delivery for 1 April 2014 to ensure continuity of service.  UKVI regions and FCO colleagues are supporting the commercial partner in securing these.  As of March 2014, 16 of 196 commercial partner Visa Application Centres have opened.  Lessons learned from these early openings are being considered and either resolved or contingency action taken.  Any potential risk to delivery continues to be monitored and resolved as necessary.",N/A,The Amber rating reflected the fact that there is time pressure to complete the tasks necessary for successful go-live  and a risk that the programme may be impacted by events outside of its control.,AMS was successfully deployed in August 2013.  The business case remains sound and realisation of benefits will commence later this year.  ,"At the time of reporting, the project was proceeding to schedule and on budget.  It is though currently under review  in the light of the availability of capital in 2015-16 and alternative proposals to provide the capacity that is needed that may provide even  better value for money. ","The rating reflected the pace, scale and complexity involved in delivering this cross government Programme.  The actions we have taken to mitigate the RAG status are as follows;  the Programme strengthened the team, resolved contracting and funding issues with stakeholders, carried out external readiness reviews and gained OBC approval from the emergency services, lead departments, CO and Treasury, to allow the procurement phase to be launched 14 Apr 2014. ","The Review into the replacement of Border Force core systems (Warnings Index and Semaphore) reported its findings in December 2013 and recommended a parallel build approach, with lower cost, early delivery, adaptability and broader scope.  The decision to adopt this option has now been made. The existing systems will continue to run for the next two years while the new capability is developed and rolled out.   "

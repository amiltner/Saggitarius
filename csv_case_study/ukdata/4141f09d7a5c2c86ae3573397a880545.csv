These tables now reflect the Machinery of Government changes included in the 2014–15 Main and Supplementary Estimates. The figures for 2010-11 to 2013-14 are therefore different to those published in the 2013–14 ARA and the prior period figures in the Accounts section of the 2014–15 ARA.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,

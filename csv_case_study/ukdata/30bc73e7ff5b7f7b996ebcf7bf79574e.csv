Following the March 2010 Budget the then Government announced a new target for central Government Departments to pay 80% of valid ,,,,,,,,,,,
invoices within 5 working days. This built upon the previous target of 10 working days which was introduced in October 2008.  The five day ,,,,,,,,,,,
 payment commitment came into force in May 2010. These targets are in addition to an existing statutory requirement to make payment to ,,,,,,,,,,,
make payment within 30 days and which continues to be the contractual term set in most DCMS procurements. Changes are being ,,,,,,,,,,,
 introduced from August to reverse the slight dip in 5 and 10 day performance that resulted from IT and internal communication issues.,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
"As part of a regular management review of prompt payment data, we have identified that 3 grant claims processed in December 2011  ",,,,,,,,,,,
were inadvertently reported as invoice payments due to incorrect supplier records. The volume and value figures in the table have been ,,,,,,,,,,,
amended to take into account this correction   ,,,,,,,,,,,

SCS in Defra and its Executive Agencies were treated as a single population (i.e. 25% of SCS across core-Defra and the Executive Agencies received NCPRP), therefore, we have prrovided a single return for the SCS across core-Defra and the Executive Agencies.  The ratio of SCS receiving NCPRP is over 25% as the number of staff eligible for consideration for a payment, i.e. those that were in the Department for the majority of the reporting year, was higher than the number of staff in post as at 31 March 2013."

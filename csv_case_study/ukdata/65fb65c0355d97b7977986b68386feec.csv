"10. Previous results for this indicator included figures for all people receiving support to cope with the effects of climate change. These results did not delineate beneficiaries by the intensity of support given nor whether the beneficiaries where targeted or not. We can now disaggregate the results to show whether support received was direct or indirect. We have decided to report direct support only as this type of support can be shown to help discrete beneficiaries cope with the effects of climate change while indirect support cannot. Definitions for direct and indirect support are given below. Direct support is where beneficiaries have been targeted and the intervention is high intensity. Examples could include people receiving social protection cash transfers, houses raised on plinths and training of individuals in communities to develop emergency plans. Beneficiaries who receive indirect support may or may not have been targeted and have received medium intensity support. Examples could include people receiving weather information or text message early warnings and people within the catchment area of a large infrastructure project (eg flood defences).",,,,,,,,
"11. Since the previous Annual Report the methodology for determining whether an election is ‘freer and fairer’ has been strengthened and clarified. The methodology draws on independent observer reports to consider the extent to which elections are credible, non-violent and reflect the will of the people. As a result of this improvement the results against election indicators for 2011–12 have been revised.",,,,,,,,
"12. The number of countries where DFID has supported freer and fairer elections which are also fragile and conflict afflicted states was two up to 2011–12 inclusive, one in 2012–13 and so three up to 2012–13 inclusive.",,,,,,,,

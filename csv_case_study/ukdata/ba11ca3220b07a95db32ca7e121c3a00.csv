###Any test carried out in an OTF herd during the period shown. Does not include Gamma tests###,,,,,
###Herds which were previously OTF but either had cattle that reacted to a tuberculin test or had a tuberculous animal disclosed by routine meat inspection at slaughter During the period shown###,,,,,
###New herd incidents where OTF status was withdrawn from the herd###,,,,,
###New herd incidents where OTF status was withdrawn from the herd divided by the number of tests on OTF herds###,,,,,
###For some new incidents testing is still underway and the incidents could become OTFW if such tests revealed one or more reactors with post-mortem evidence of TB or a positive culture result###,,,,,
###These are known as 'unclassified' (see footnote 9 in the datasets). The incidence rate presented here is the average of OTFW/tests on OTF herds and (OTFW+unclassifed)/tests on OTF herds###,,,,,
"###New herd incidents where OTF status was withdrawn from the herd, divided by the amount of time herds tested during that period were unrestricted and at risk of infection###",,,,,
###New incidents where OFT withdrawn is calculated for 12 month periods on a quarterly basis. The figure given for March 1996 refers to the 12 months ending March 1996. Figures are not calculated for the intervening months###,,,,,

A number of programmes can be disaggregated to local level – these are either shown at national or regional levels. Programme splits at regional level are reported in two ways – either regional spend which cannot be disaggregated to local level (shows as region wide) or national spend which cannot be disaggregated below regional level (shown as National (region)). In future the HCA would look to report this as an aggregate amount of expenditure that cannot be disaggregated to the local level.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Description / Aims 
","The project aims to establish sustainable air services to St Helena to promote economic development and increased financial self-sufficiency, leading eventually to graduation from UK budgetary support. 

This will be done through the construction of an airport and the introduction of scheduled air services.  The project also includes support to the operation of the airport for a period of ten years and the construction of a wharf.  The project will put in place the necessary legal, regulatory and monitoring framework, and includes a series of reforms to be implemented by the St Helena Government to open up the island to inward investment and increased tourism.",,,,,,,,,,
Departmental commentary on actions planned or taken on the MPA RAG rating.,"Airport construction is current on time and to budget, the Amber delivery confidence rating reflected concerns the significant challenges which the project has to overcome, particularly in the areas of securing a Fuel Management Contractor, an Air Service Provider and long term economic development.  Some of these were outside the remit of the Board (the group governing the project). In February 2013, the Board expanded its remit to cover a number of additional deliverables, required to achieve the project’s longer term objective.",,,,,,,,,,

"Departmental narrative on schedule, including any deviation from planned schedule (if necessary)","There has been good progress on the earthworks (scheduled for completion October 2014) and on construction of the airport buildings (scheduled for completion early 2015).  Trials for concreting the runway started February 2014.

The project remains on track to deliver to the planned schedule (February 2016 for airport construction).

"Departmental narrative on  budget/forecast variance for 2013/14
(if variance is more than 5%)","The 2013/14 spend forecasts were revised to include the costs for a wharf at Rupert's Bay in St Helena.  The wharf costs were approved as a provisional sum in the original business case and airport contract. It was not possible to accurately predict the spending profile until September 2013 when a Supplementary Agreement confirming the construction of the wharf was signed with the airport contractor.  While this has resulted in bringing forward the costs associated with the wharf, it does not affect the overall project budget ceiling. ",,,,,,,,,,
Departmental narrative on budgeted whole life costs,"The whole life costs cover the 40 year design life of the airport. The costs are attributable to both the UK Government and St Helena Government; with UK Government commitment due to cease in 2026 after 10 years of airport operations.  DFID are confident of delivering the project within the agreed budget ceiling.

Areas of expenditure included when calculating the whole-life cost are: planning, design, construction, operations, maintenance, asset renewal and/or disposal.  

As the project is forecasting so far into the future (2046) there are high levels of uncertainty pertaining to some of the costs.

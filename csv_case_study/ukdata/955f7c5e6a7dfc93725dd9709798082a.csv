HMRC,HMRC,23/05/2016,Government Procurement Service (GPS) Fees,CTISA,CALDER CONFERENCES LTD,1900074455,1.2,"HMRC were asked by the Global Forum for Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes (which is part of the OECD) to host this regional training event in London.  It was held externally from 9-13 May 2016.

Hosting this event reflected the UKs wholehearted commitment to devoting the necessary resources to ensure the success of the work of the Global Forum in driving up the global standards of tax transparency.  The UK has a vested interest in this as it wishes to ensure that all countries are playing their part, and hence directly and indirectly assisting HMRCs fight against tax evasion and avoidance.   Providing training ensures that our own standards are known and promoted across the world.

50 people (including 4 people from HMRC) were trained during the event to be assessors to work in a part-time capacity to assess the capacity and capability of peer countries in the field of tax transparency and to recommend improvements.

We went through the Calders as they are the official route for organising external events.  We researched the option of holding the event outside of London in order to reduce costs but given the logistics of getting 50+ people from 27 different countries to a location outside London, we decided it would be best to host the event in central London. CR explained the unexpected expenditure this event would incur and that it had not been previously budgeted for so managed to negotiate a 9,000 contribution from the OECD  towards the event.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Therefore our outlay will be 17,514.00 for the event.  We were billed for the whole amount 26k from Calders as the OECD contribution of 9k cannot be taken into account until they invoice them separately.  This was send to OECD on 8 June and we have been told it will take approximately 45 days to process. So we should assume the net figure is 17k.

CR gained approval from Corp Comms for an amount of 23,425  on 20 January 2016, so our total outlay is below the approved limit.",LS16 6RF,,,,

The UK has a vested interest in this as it wishes to ensure that all countries are playing their part, and hence directly and indirectly assisting HMRCs fight against tax evasion and avoidance.   Providing training ensures that our own standards are known and promoted across the world.

50 people (including 4 people from HMRC) were trained during the event to be assessors to work in a part-time capacity to assess the capacity and capability of peer countries in the field of tax transparency and to recommend improvements.

We went through the Calders as they are the official route for organising external events.  We researched the option of holding the event outside of London in order to reduce costs but given the logistics of getting 50+ people from 27 different countries to a location outside London, we decided it would be best to host the event in central London. CR explained the unexpected expenditure this event would incur and that it had not been previously budgeted for so managed to negotiate a 9,000 contribution from the OECD  towards the event.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Therefore our outlay will be 17,514.00 for the event.  We were billed for the whole amount 26k from Calders as the OECD contribution of 9k cannot be taken into account until they invoice them separately.  This was send to OECD on 8 June and we have been told it will take approximately 45 days to process. So we should assume the net figure is 17k.

CR gained approval from Corp Comms for an amount of 23,425  on 20 January 2016, so our total outlay is below the approved limit.",LS16 6RF,,,,

Table 7.1:  Public Spending,,,,
,,,,
This table summarises budgets and outturn on a basis consistent with the Estimate Part II section headings.  One adjustment has been made for the period 2007-08 to 2010-11 where capital grants are reflected in outturn as resource but are funded by capital. The revised format of note 2 now reflects this change to the Accounts.,,,,
"As a result of the new Ministers, appointed during 2010-11, a new basis of assessing aid delivery was formed.  This allocates aid across 5 pillars.  As outturn for the previous 5 years was not based on this methodology it is not appropriate to restate these figures, on this basis.  As a result the original Estimate headings are displayed for outturn from 2007-08 to 2010-11, with only Plan data shown on the new basis.  This is consistent with information available on Online System for Central Accounting and Reporting (OSCAR).",,,,

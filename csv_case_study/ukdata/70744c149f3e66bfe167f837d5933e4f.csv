"This list sets out the Secretary of State’s meetings with senior media executives for the period May 2010-July 2011. This includes all meetings with proprietors, senior executives and editors of media organisations for both newspapers and broadcast media. It does not include those meetings with journalists that ended up in interviews that appeared in the public domain, either in newspapers and magazines. It may also exclude some larger social events at which senior media executives may have been present.",,,
"This is the fullest possible list assembled from the Secretary of State’s Parliamentary diary, their departmental diary, personal diary and memory. Every effort has been taken to ensure that this is as accurate as possible but the nature of such an extensive exercise means something may have inadvertently got missed.",,,

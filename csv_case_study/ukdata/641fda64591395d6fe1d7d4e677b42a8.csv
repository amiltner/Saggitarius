• Total paybill of on-payroll staff has increased by £289,268 when compared to November due to an increase in the on-payroll staffing level.  56% of new starters in December were appointed into roles at NHS Band 7 and above, resulting in the higher cost increase relative to the numnber of new starters.
• Decrease in off payroll compliant workers by 25 in December compared to November. NHS England are currently unable to fully report non-compliant totals as these are not held centrally within a system or database for the FY16/17 at present. A project to address enhancements and improvements to offpayroll controls continues to progress within NHS England.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           • NHS England's off payroll worker project is currently in the process of reviewing its off-payroll workers management and control processes.

"[1] Staff should not normally accept gifts.  Heads of Unit, or equivalent, have delegated authority to decide on whether it would be right and proper to accept offers of gifts.  If a member of staff  or the department  is in any doubt about the propriety of the purchase or the acceptance of a gift, the offer must be refused",,
"[2] Hospitality does not normally include attendance at functions hosted by HM Government; ‘diplomatic’ functions in the UK or abroad, hosted by overseas governments; minor refreshments at meetings, receptions, conferences, and seminars;  and offers of hospitality which were declined. ",,
